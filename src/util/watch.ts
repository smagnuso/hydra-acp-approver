// Watch a config file by watching its parent directory and filtering on

// over the target (vim, helix, JetBrains) — those flip the inode, which
// a direct `fs.watch(path)` would stop tracking. It also gracefully
// handles the file not existing yet at startup: as soon as a matching
// filename appears in the directory, the watcher fires.
//
// Symlinks: inotify on a directory only sees changes to entries in that
// directory; editing the target of a symlink that lives there does not
// touch the symlink itself, so a naive single watcher misses edits
// through the symlink. We resolve the realpath at startup and, when it
// differs from the literal path, watch both parents — the literal one
// to catch the symlink being created/swapped/removed, and the realpath
// one to catch edits to the actual file. If the symlink doesn't exist
// yet we just watch the literal parent and the realpath watcher is
// added later (on the next reload, the caller can recreate us).
